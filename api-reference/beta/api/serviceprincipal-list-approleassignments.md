# List appRoleAssignments granted to a service principal

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the list of [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) that have been granted to a service principal.

App roles that are assigned to service principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Application permissions can be granted directly by creating app role assignments, or through a [consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
