# List teamsApp

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List [apps](../resources/teamsapp.md) from the Microsoft Teams app catalog.
This includes apps from the Microsoft Teams store, as well as apps from your organization's app catalog (the tenant app catalog). To get apps from your organization's app catalog only, specify `organization` as the **distributionMethod** in the request.

## Optional query parameters

Using `$expand=AppDefinitions` will return more information about the state of the app, such as the **publishingState**, which reflects the app submission review status and returns whether an app has been approved, rejected, or remains under review. 

> **Note:** You can filter on any of the fields of the [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) object to shorten the list of results. You can use any of the following filter operations: Equal, not-equal, and, or, and not.
